          I worked with them on this 3-month project to tackle the problem by creating a postive online experience. I did comprehensive user research to collect needs and pain-points, and then brought ideas to fruition after rounds of validation and iteration.

          After discussion, we reached an agreement that our goal is to establish a comprehensive customer and order management system, as well as an online shop, or we can say a useful ordering tool. Considering the development cost and user characteristics, we finally decided to develop a mini app based on WeChat and build a CRM of our own
        </div>  

        <div class="fs18 padding30">
          <div>The benefits of doing this are: </div>
          <div>1.Almost all Chinese have WeChat, which greatly reduces the cost of learning for our customers. Moreover, most of our customers are elderly people who lack network experience. </div>
          <div>2, reduced development costs, small programs provide a lot of interfaces according to different industries, the adaptation of Android and ios is also easier. </div>
          <div>3, The traffic on WeChat is huge, which is helpful for the promotion and branding.</div>
        </div>  

        <div class="fs18 padding30">
          Since the front end uses a mini app, the backend cannot apply the existing service platform, so we decided to design a management system separately.
        </div>

        <div class="fs18 padding30">
          One point need to mention is that the Yiminghui does not want to make a traditional e-commerce to expand sales on a large scale, because their products need to be delivered in time. According to the scale of the factory, it can only serve cities within 5 hours drive, which determines that the online store is not a typical e-commerce, it’s more like a convenient tool to place orders

        <div class="fs18 padding30">
          After validating various concepts with participants and clients, their feedback led me to create and develop prototypes. For both internal management system and online shop. I went through 1 round of paper prototyping, 2 rounds of medium fidelity, and 2 rounds of high-fidelity. The low-fidelity prototypes focused on concept validation and simple usability. The medium-fidelity rounds were more concerned with testing usability and flow between screens. Lastly, the high-fidelity prototypes focused on content and visual design.

          During our medium-fidelity prototyping phase,the accountant、customer service、sales person and two of the clients participated in the usability testing.It consisted of 2 rounds with a total of 6 participants. For both rounds, we used Sketch and mockingbot to create a clickable prototype that participants interacted with inside a web browser.
